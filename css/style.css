/**
 * The styleheets of Customizr are located in inc/css. Each skin has its own stylesheet : blue.css, green.css, ...
 *
 * IMPORTANT : If you write your CSS code below, it will be deleted when you'll update the theme.
 * If you want to style the css of Customizr, you can either use the Custom CSS section in the customizer (which will not be lost on update) OR create a child theme (recommended if you do many customizations) and add your css code in the style.css file of it.
